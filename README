    1. Netqos

Netqos is a virtual device for 2.6 linux kernels.



    2. External data is needed to compile and test!

That's right, you will need about 1,5 GB of external data to compile
and test netqos the way I do it. Of course none of these external
data is included in this distribution. You will have to get it
yourself. That way I keep this distribution small and avoid the
inclusion of external software.



    2.1 What external data I need and how do I get it?

To compile netqos you will need a full kernel source tree.

To test netqos the way I do it, you will need an UML kernel
and some root filesystems to boot it.

I have write some scripts to help you/me to get all these things.
They are under the extdata-generator/ directory. You will need to edit the
extdata-generator/CONFIGUREME file before executing those scritps. Then just
execute each of the scripts in alphanumerical order.

If you are trying to compile an older kernel in some new distributions
you will also need to copy /usr/include/sys/user.h to
/usr/include/asm/user.h.



    3. Kernel tree compilation

The scripts to download and compile a kernel are:

    extdata-generator/00-download-kernel-tree.sh
    extdata-generator/01-compile-uml-kernel.sh

To compile a 2.6 linux kernel module you will need a compiled linux
kernel source tree. I'm going to use UML as the compilation architecture
as the testing and debugging of the kernel module is safer and easier.

When configuring the kernel compilation remember to adapt it to your
CPU and to include hostfs support. Also remember to include all the
debugging options you need; some of the following wil be usefull:

CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP
CONFIG_INIT_DEBUG
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE
CONFIG_KALLSYMS
CONFIG_IKCONFIG
CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC
CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG
CONFIG_DEBUG_DRIVER
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS
CONFIG_PROFILING

See doc/uml-compilation.txt for instructions about how to compile
such a kernel. If you edit the CONFIGUREME file and used my extdata-generator/
scripts to generate all the needed external data, you will only need
to invoke "make" to compile the module.



    4. Test the module

    4.1 UML rootfs creation

See doc/01-uml-rootfs-creation.txt for instruction about how to create
the rootfs for the UML systems. If you used my extdata-generator/ scripts you have
already create a working rootfs.


    4.2 Launch the rootfs

Just launch it with the newly generated "rootfs/run-uml.sh". There is
only one user "root" with no passwd.


    4.3 Test the module

You will find the module and the load and unload scripts at:

/mnt/host-tmp/netqos.ko
/mnt/host-tmp/netqos_load
/mnt/host-tmp/netqos_unload

Use one of the UML terminals to monitor kernels logs:

; tail -f /var/log/kern.log | egrep -v "IRQ 10/winch|Failed to open console|getmaster - no usable host pty"

Use the other terminal to play with the module:

client:~# cd /mnt/host-tmp
client:/mnt/host-tmp# modinfo netqos.ko
