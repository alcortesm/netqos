You have to build a kobject in the module.

LDDv3 explains kobjects on chapter 14 "The Linux Device Model". But it
a very basic introduction and it did not mention how to build sys/
trees without a character or block device or how to implement poll()
support for the driver.

In "_linux-src_/Documentation/kobject.txt", there is a section about
building simple /sys/ trees called "Creating "simple" kobjects
" and explains kobject_create_and_add(), sysfs_create_file(),
sysfs_create_group(). There is an explample of use at
"_linux-src_/samples/kobject-example.c".

Poll() supoort was not included in the sys/ until very late, see
"Some upcoming sysfs enhancements" (2006-03-07) at
